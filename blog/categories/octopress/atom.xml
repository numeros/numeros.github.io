    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps the biggest problem with java executables happened in GNU/Linux Debian.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2327">https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2327</a> and for many users, the solution was in fact to compile and install the source code for <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/">node.js</a>.</p>

<p>The aforementioned was the only option that successfully worked for me as well. Therubyracer package failed, and changing the options in the <em>_conf.yml</em> file made no difference either.</p>

<p>One of the problems I also encountered while pushing the commits to github, was in fact the message:</p>

<pre><code>   Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
   hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
   hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
</code></pre>

<p>and as suggested in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a>,<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12651399">git says local branch is behind remote branch</a> I tried the recommended approach of fixing it by:</p>

<pre><code>  git push -f 
</code></pre>

<p>to no avail. So I opted to &mdash;since for one, the repository had been recently created- to delete the fairly new created repository, and create a new one afterwards.</p>

<p>At least it seemed to take care of the problem.</p>
